# Design Patterns

Solutions to commonly occurring problems in a given context.

## Why are they needed?

## Structural Patterns

### Proxy

**Proxy** is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
